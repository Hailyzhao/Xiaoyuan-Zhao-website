        <p class="lead mb-4"> I participated in a volunteer team AYSC (Asian Youth Services Committee) during high school. The club is my favorite because it is a group that connects me with other volunteers, allowing me to socialize with others who also want to make our community better. The money the charity earns gets donated to the police, so they can also contribute to our city. Volunteering makes me a more rounded individual and make my community better at the same time. My goal for the near future would still be giving back to my community as they have raised and educated me.
 Every summer I also volunteer at OACC (Oakland Asian Cultural Center) a summer program as a teacherâ€™s assistant. My job is to correct studentsâ€™ essays and other homework which lightens the teacherâ€™s workload. I also created an idea in which I offered to the teachers  to use Chinese kids songs to teach children Chinese. The teacher and I divided the lyrics and explained them in detail to the students of what each character means in Chinese. 
I know that this society really needs my strength. In these groups, I learned to be united and confident.
<br><br>

         When I was twelve, I immigrated to America.  I am a person who likes to talk a lot but in America, nobody talked to me because I did not speak English. I turned into a quiet person, but I began to develop an interest in mathematics. Math is a language that the whole world is fluent in. This is the only subject I was best at. 
The only disadvantage I have in math are word problems. When I first learned about word problems, my grades and I both became depressed. I was terrified that I even have to give up on math, my favorite subject. I lost hope. My grades did not go back up and I knew this was not me. I knew I am a person who could get back up after a fall, but I could not this time. Good thing I met an outstanding and responsible teacher that was willing to help me go through all my hardships. She would use simple words and body language to communicate. Although my grades still did not reach up to my expectations, I was satisfied with my progress. 
        Throughout high school, my math had maintained. Because of this, I decided that I would like to study business in the future. Business itself is a calm job and it will allow me to concentrate on one thing at a time.

         When I was 12 years old, I immigrated to the United States as a young new student. I remember witnessing unfamiliar words on building and billboards, different people, and having to go to a whole new school within the first few days. In the beginning, I was nervous about communicating with others and I was afraid to talk to classmates. I greatly regretted that I didnâ€™t study English seriously before, because my English was terrible at the time. 
       Many people didnâ€™t want to talk to me because of the language barrier. Not confident in my English speaking skills, I was always hesitant to make friends and speak to fellow students. I felt scared and alone as reality constantly hit me- I was in a completely new place with no one to help me. I then realized that the only person who could help me was myself. I resolved to improve my language skills and I made new friends who, luckily, were Chinese-Americans. 
       When I hung out with my friends, I would repeat what they said in order to learn more english and try to be a native. After that, I found I learned English faster when I went to work at milk tea store. Because under the pressure of the environment, I must learn English and must communicate with customers in English. Now that think about it, I have been working for 2 years. While I was working, I not only learned a lot of new words and new ways of chatting, I also accumulated many years of work experience, working hard to become a cashier. Because the cashier meets different guests every day and hears different languages, I took the opportunity to learn a little more English.  I have also enhanced my communication skills through work.
